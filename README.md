# CodinGame Challenges 2024

This repository contains the scripts developed for the **Fall Challenge 2024** and **Winter Challenge 2024** of [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/). 

Here you will find solutions based on **advanced automation** and **complex algorithms**, designed to maximize efficiency in highly competitive environments through the use of **artificial intelligence**, **advanced heuristics**, and **data processing**.

## Challenges

### 🏙️ Fall Challenge 2024 - *Selenia City*
**Description:**
- The objective was to design a transportation network in the first lunar city, inaugurated in 2050.
- Participants had 20 lunar months to manage resources and connect buildings.
- The infrastructure had to be optimized to maximize efficiency using advanced **route optimization**, **resource management**, and **real-time data analysis** techniques.

### 🦠 Winter Challenge 2024 - *Cellularena*
**Description:**
- A challenge focused on organism growth in a grid-based environment.
- Each organism had to consume proteins and expand to outgrow its opponents.
- Strategies were needed to maximize growth and minimize the risk of being surrounded, applying **pathfinding algorithms**, **territorial expansion heuristics**, and **strategic decision automation**.
